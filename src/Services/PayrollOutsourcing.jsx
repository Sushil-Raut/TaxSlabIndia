        <h2>What is Payroll Outsourcing?</h2>
        <p>
          Payroll outsourcing is the process of hiring a third-party service
          provider to handle payroll functions, including salary computation,
          tax filing, statutory compliance, payslip generation, and more. It
          allows businesses to focus on core activities while ensuring accuracy,
          confidentiality, and compliance with legal norms.
