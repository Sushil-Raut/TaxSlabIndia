        <p className="section-description">
            GST Return is a process used to declare the Goods and Services Tax
            (GST) liability of a taxpayer. It is an online form that contains
            the details of all the supplies made, input tax credit availed, and
            the GST due for a particular period. It must be filed regularly, as
            per the GST law, to ensure that the taxpayer complies with the GST
            regulations. Moreover, it ensures that the GST collected is properly
            deposited with the government in a timely manner.

              </h4>
              <p className="faq-answer">
                Every registered GST taxpayer is required to file GST returns
                either monthly, quarterly, or annually depending on the business
                type and turnover.

              <h4 className="faq-question">
                When must I upload my invoice on the GST portal?
              </h4>
              <p className="faq-answer">
                Invoices should be uploaded monthly/quarterly as per your filing
                cycle. Usually, before the 10th of the next month for GSTR-1.

                What is the procedure for revising the return under GST?
              </h4>
              <p className="faq-answer">
                GST returns once filed cannot be revised. Any changes must be
                made in the next monthâ€™s return through amendments.

              </h4>
              <p className="faq-answer">
                Late filing attracts interest and a late fee. It can also block
                e-way bill generation and lead to cancellation of GST
                registration.
